- 👋 Hi, I’m @8riaN
- 👀 I’m interested in most things. This repo is currently for Web Development, especially WordPress, but I might find other uses for it later :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to transition to open source development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Wordpress plugins/themes; cloud-based LAMP deployment, curious about docker, etc. containers; Interested in troubleshooting legacy projects - I have worked professionally in PHP, Javascript, CSS, HTML, ColdFusion, ASP.NET, C#, Visual Basic, and... wait for it...good ol' Basic (& MegaBasic: Basic with named subroutines, wow that was a long time ago...); the MS Office Suite, Pre-Press and Desktop Publishing; and in Windows from 3.1-10, MacOS, Android OS (for personal stuf only, so far) and MS-DOS. All of which I taught myself, so if you have a system for you can't find an expert, I'll take a look. I bet I can figure it out. I LOVE troubleshooting and haven't failed yet on anything I've put my mind to :) I have had (and might still have?) my code running in places like Madison Square Garden, Camden Yards, and The Golden Gate Bridge Toll Plaza. My first programming job was in 1984 reverse engineering a custom estimating program in Basic for my dad's printing company. He had 50 employees and I was 16.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm papabrian on gmail and the top few social media platforms, but try commenting here, first.
