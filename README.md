- 👋 Hi, I’m @8riaN
- 👀 I’m interested in most things. This place is for Web Development, but I might find other uses for it later :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to transition to open source development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Wordpress plugins/themes; cloud-based LAMP deployment, curious about docker, etc. containers; Interested in troubleshooting legacy projects - I have worked professionally in PHP, Javascript, CSS, HTML, ColdFusion, ASP.NET, C#, Visual Basic, and... wait for it...good ol' Basic & MegaBasic (Basic with named subroutines, wow that was a long time ago...); the MS Office Suite, Pre-Press and Desktop Publishing; and in Windows from 3.1-10, MacOS, Android OS (for personal stuf, only so far) and MS-DOS. All of which I taught myself, so if you have a system for you can't find an expert, I'll take a look. I LOVE troubleshooting :)
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm papabrian on gmail and the top few social media platforms, but try commenting here, first.
